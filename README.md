# COVID-19-Tracking-with-GNUPlot

This is a pretty simple bash script that grabs the current data on COVID-19 from various Github repos that track the numbers and pipes the data from the CSV file into GNUPlot for an animated dipiction of daily increases in COVID-19 death, hospitalizations, and infections in the form of a GIF.
